## Annotation of the S. mediterranea genome
This notebook describes the annotation of the sexual planarian genome (Schmidtea mediterranea) based on total RNA-seq data from this species. In short, took advantage of the Stringtie annotation pipeline by using 183 planarian RNA-seq reads as the raw RNA-seq material and the PlanMine sexual genome annotation (SMESG-high) as the reference annotation.

## Annotation of the D. japonica genome
